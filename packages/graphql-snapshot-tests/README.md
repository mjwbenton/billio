# Billio GraphQL Snapshot Tests

## `yarn test`

These tests take snapshots of API responses. To run them correctly you need to have already started a local dev server. Do not run against the actual production data (i.e. run the dev server without USE_PROD_TABLE set).

Use `-u` to update the snapshots.
